        <h3 class="section__title">Post-University. <small>Aug 21 - Current</small></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Since graduating from University, I have aimed to keep my coding and technology skills alive and evolving. This has been achieved by exploring unfamiliar areas around technology and undertaking small projects of development.</li>

          <li> In the Software Development Sphere, I have been perusing common frameworks for Web development, such as Angular.JS and have completed their “Tour of Heroes” tutorial project. Simultaneously I have constructed my CV website, utilising HTML and CSS to present the needed information in a pleasant and aesthetic format. </li>

          <li>Both examples where also good exercises in using industry level tools in the form of Git version control with GitHub, and Visual Studio Code for my Integrated Development Environment. I have also been exploring some framework agnostic themed projects, such as creating a personalised reference sheet for JavaScript Array operators utilising written explanations, JSDoc style comments and small code examples.</li> 

          <li>On the wider technology part of my endeavours, I have undertaken a long-term personal project of creating a "Home Server" with my old High-Spec PC being the starting point eliminating the need to make expensive purchases off the bat. This pet project has allowed me to explore more into Linux, CLIs, virtualisation of Virtual Machines, Services, Storage and Network infrastructure, and the basics of network configuration.</li>

          <li>Within the last 6 months, I have also worked to finish obtaining my Full UK Driving license.</li>

          <li>Alongside my final year of University, I held a part-time job to help support myself financially, which expanded into a Full-time position once I had graduated due to the economic pressures around the pandemic. Due to this role being within the “key worker” category, it allowed me to have an income without the risk of being placed on furlough or made redundant at another company I’d have been trying to join. The decision to stay at this role and not immediately search for an industry / post-graduate job was also bolstered with the geographical uncertainty faced whilst my partner finished their own bachelor's degree this academic year.</li>
